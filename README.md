# UTSSRP - Chromosome Contact Matrix Analysis
This project was completed during the inaugural University of Toronto Statistical Sciences Research Program.
It focuses on constructing and analyzing chromosome contact matrices based on genomic interaction data. The dataset consists of contact counts between pairs of chromosome locations, indicating how often regions of the genome come into the contact. 
The main objectives of the project are:

## Description

The main objectives of the project are:
#### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Convert chromosome names into numeric form for easier processing
- ...

#### 2. Contact Matrix Construction
- For each chromosome pair, create a submatrix representing contact frequencies between all bin pairs
- Assemble all submatrices into one large genome-wide contact matrix

#### 3. Summary Statistics and Visualizations
- Generate heatmaps to visualize the intensity of contacts across the genome.
- Plot contact decay curves to study how contact frequency decreases with genomic distance.
  

#### 4. Analysis and Comparison
